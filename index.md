# Sensitivity of optimal choice of vaccination strategy to changes in social contact patterns
## Abstract

*Background* The Bayesian framework allows one to use prior information when calibrating transmission models of vaccination policy. Previous transmission models have not assessed the value of prior information of the contact patterns. However, many vaccine policy decisions are based on quantifying the value of indirect effects from vaccination, such as LAIV. Many countries do not have empirical studies describing their contact patterns, and often those of geographical neighbours are used.<br/>
*Methods* We fit and parameterized a transmission model of influenza in Great Britain using survey data from 10 other countries to construct counterfactual contact patterns. Using the counterfactual contact patterns we conducted cost-effectiveness analysis of three pediatric vaccination policies and compared the results to those derived using the country-specific Great Britain contact structure.<br/>
*Results* Country-specific contact patterns add value in calibrating transmission models. Specifically, the prior information on contact patterns do not converge on the same posterior, such that oneâ€™s posterior belief about the relative importance of each age group in transmission changes based on the prior information. We show the relative impact of age groups on transmission that come from the choice of contact patterns used as priors decreases the probability a strategy is considered cost-effective by propagating uncertainty through the model.<br/>
*Conclusion* Even using substitute patterns as prior information can alter vaccine decision-making. Therefore, we would advocate that in the absence of country-specific contact patterns, structural uncertainty analysis should be undertaken when quantifying the effect of strategies that involve herd immunity.

### Data Sources

#### Social Contact Data
We obtained contact data from multiple sources most notably the POLYMOD study (Mossong et al., 2008), but also from similar studies in Zimbabwe, Peru, and France using the [Zenodo database](https://zenodo.org/communities/social_contact_data?page=1&size=20). Raw survey data  was downloaded and weighted by contacts for weekday vs weekend following the method described by Baguelin et al. (2015) using the code in [INPUT_polymod_pull](https://github.com/tajwenzel/IntlSens/blob/master/INPUT_polymod_pull.R). 

#### Other Data

Other data which was needed for these analyses are included in the repository:
* Vaccine uptake rate functions for final coverage estimated at 30%, 55%, and 70% starting on September 1st and continuing till December 12th in [cov.function30.Rdata](https://github.com/tajwenzel/IntlSens/blob/master/cov.function30.RData), [cov.function55.Rdata](https://github.com/tajwenzel/IntlSens/blob/master/cov.function55.RData), [cov.function70.Rdata](https://github.com/tajwenzel/IntlSens/blob/master/cov.function70.RData), respectively.
* New LAIV and TIIV vaccine costs by delivery method laid out in Supplemental Section, Table 5.
* Prior distributions for Markov chain Monte Carlo laid out in Supplemental Section Table 3.
* Incidence of Influenza-like-illnesses from 1995-2009 in the UK in [ili.counts](https://github.com/tajwenzel/IntlSens/blob/master/ili.counts.rda)
* [Laboratory virological testing data](https://github.com/tajwenzel/IntlSens/blob/master/virological.rda) that contains information on strains and number of laboratory tests for the hypergeometric distribution in the MCMC.

#### Data stored in the workspace

The file (Intl_general_parameters.Rdata)[https://github.com/tajwenzel/IntlSens/blob/master/Intl_general_parameters.RData] contains multiple small data pieces that are used in model fitting and simulations. 'Popv' refers to the number of people in the population stratified by age and risk group. Likewise, age group limits show the margins by which age strata are defined and the number of people in each strata in the UK population. 'risk.ratios.ce' shown the risk of being in the high risk group vs the low risk group.

##### Vaccine coverage and vaccine efficacy per season
 Vaccine coverage is contained in three different lists named 'coverageH1', 'coverageH3', and 'coverageB'. Each list contains the empirical cumulative coverage for each of the 7 age strata in columns 2-23, column 1 is a date in numerical format, and columns 23-43 contain the vaccine efficacy for that particular viral strain (e.g. H1N1, H3N2) during that influenza season. List element 1 correspondes with the 1995/1996 influenza season, while the 19th list element corresponds with 2013/2014. An example of this data is shown below for 'coverageB' referring to specific vaccine coverage and vaccine efficacy for influenza B strain.

 All three lists are stored in 'cov.eff.data' as well.
 
 
 ##### Labels
 
 'fname' refers to the different abbreviations for each country (e.g. DE for Germany, NL for the Netherlands). 'allpolymod' contains the files names for all the contact surveys (e.g. DEtable11.csv) which refers to the german survey stratified into 11 age groups.
